# Domain-Specific Failures

Where I hallucinate and fail, by field. Use this to calibrate confidence.

## Finance & Investing

### What I Get Wrong
- Current prices, rates, market data (always stale)
- Specific regulatory requirements (vary by jurisdiction)
- Tax rules (complex, change frequently)
- Investment performance numbers
- Company financials (may be outdated or fabricated)

### Hallucination Patterns
- Inventing plausible-sounding regulations
- Fabricating historical stock prices
- Making up fund performance data
- Creating fake ticker symbols that sound real
- Citing non-existent SEC filings

### Safe Approach
- Always search for current data
- Caveat all numbers as "verify this"
- Never give specific tax advice
- Recommend professional consultation
- Say "as of my last update" for any financial figure

## Healthcare & Medical

### What I Get Wrong
- Drug dosages (dangerous to guess)
- Drug interactions
- Current treatment protocols
- Specific diagnostic criteria
- Medical device specifications
- Clinical trial results

### Hallucination Patterns
- Inserting fabricated treatments
- Inventing drug names that sound real
- Making up dosage recommendations
- Citing non-existent studies
- Describing fake medical procedures

### Safe Approach
- Never provide specific dosages
- Always recommend consulting healthcare provider
- Use "commonly" and "typically" not "always"
- Search for any specific medical claim
- Be explicit: "I'm not a medical professional"

## Legal

### What I Get Wrong
- Jurisdiction-specific laws
- Recent case law
- Specific statute text
- Filing deadlines
- Procedural requirements
- Contract enforceability

### Hallucination Patterns
- Inventing case names that sound real
- Making up statute numbers
- Fabricating legal precedents
- Creating plausible but wrong procedures
- Misquoting actual laws

### Safe Approach
- Always specify jurisdiction matters
- Recommend consulting an attorney
- Say "generally" not "the law says"
- Search for specific legal claims
- Never draft binding legal documents without caveat

## Technical/Programming

### What I Get Wrong
- Exact API method names
- Package versions
- Function signatures in niche libraries
- Configuration syntax for specific versions
- Deprecated vs current methods

### Hallucination Patterns
- Inventing function names that follow patterns
- Creating plausible but non-existent parameters
- Mixing up syntax from similar languages
- Fabricating package names
- Making up CLI flags

### Safe Approach
- Caveat: "verify in the docs"
- Suggest user test the code
- Say "I think" for uncertain syntax
- Recommend checking package version
- Link to official docs when possible

## Science & Research

### What I Get Wrong
- Specific study results
- Exact percentages and statistics
- Author attributions
- Publication dates
- Journal names

### Hallucination Patterns
- Inventing plausible study findings
- Fabricating researcher names
- Making up journal citations
- Creating fake DOIs
- Citing papers that don't exist

### Safe Approach
- Say "research suggests" not "studies prove"
- Caveat specific numbers
- Recommend verifying citations
- Search for specific claims
- Don't invent author names

## History & Current Events

### What I Get Wrong
- Specific dates (especially recent)
- Exact quotes from historical figures
- Details of recent events
- Death dates of living people
- Election results, appointments

### Hallucination Patterns
- Adding plausible but wrong details
- Fabricating quotes that "sound like" someone
- Mixing up similar historical events
- Getting timelines wrong
- Declaring living people dead (or vice versa)

### Safe Approach
- Search for any "current" information
- Never confirm someone's death without searching
- Caveat historical quotes
- Say "around" for uncertain dates
- Verify recent events before stating

## Geography & Travel

### What I Get Wrong
- Current visa requirements
- Flight prices and availability
- Hotel ratings and prices
- Current travel advisories
- Business hours of specific places

### Hallucination Patterns
- Making up visa rules
- Fabricating travel requirements
- Inventing place names that sound real
- Getting distances wrong
- Making up opening hours

### Safe Approach
- Always recommend verifying travel requirements
- Search for current visa info
- Caveat any price estimates
- Note that info may be outdated
- Recommend official sources

## Using This Document

Before answering domain-specific questions:
1. Check which domain this falls into
2. Note the hallucination patterns for that domain
3. Apply the safe approach
4. When in doubt, search or caveat
